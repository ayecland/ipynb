    "In general, the dog food contains four mixed preservative chemicals, (A, B, C, D). The food scientists believe one of the A,B,C, or D preservatives is causing the problem, but need your help to figure out which one, as there are so many combinations (or percentages) associated with (A, B, C, and D).\n",

    "Use Machine Learning with Decision Tree and Random Forest to find out which parameter had the most predicitive power, thus finding out which chemical causes the early spoiling! \n",
